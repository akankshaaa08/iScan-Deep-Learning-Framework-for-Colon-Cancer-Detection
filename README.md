# iScan: A DeepLearning Framework for detection of Colon Cancer

iScan is a three-phase deep learning architecture that detects and identifies colorectal cancer and its current stage in CT-Scan images. SegNet architecture and a five-layer Sequential model were developed in order to segment and classify the malignant tumors from the benign ones. The assessment of the stages of cancer is carried out by mapping it with the area of the cancerous tumor.
